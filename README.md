# project-using-Postgresql

This project demonstrates a simple PostgreSQL database setup using pgAdmin, designed to manage a bookstore system. It includes three core datasets in CSV format: books.csv, customers.csv, and orders.csv.
🗂️ Project Highlights
books.csv – Contains details about available books (title, author, price, etc.).
customers.csv – Stores customer information (name, email, location).
orders.csv – Tracks purchase transactions linking customers to books.

🛠️ How It Works
The CSV files were imported directly into PostgreSQL using pgAdmin's import feature, with tables created and populated via the graphical interface — no manual SQL scripts required for data insertion.

****How do I import a CSV file in pgAdmin?**
Right-click the table → Import/Export Data
Choose Import, select the CSV file
Map columns if needed, then click OK
